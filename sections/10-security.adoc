== Security Considerations

Security considerations of the vObject formats
themselves *MUST* be adhered to, including:

* vCard: <<RFC6350>>
* iCalendar: <<RFC5545>>, <<RFC4791>>
* vObject: <<I-D.calconnect-vobject-vformat>>

vObject formats, especially for calendaring, scheduling
and contact exchange, often involve privacy-sensitive information.
Internationalization features defined in this document
*MAY* pose risk of exposing private information if
interchanged through unprotected communication channels.

Mechanisms used for the transmission of such information
should implement security measures to protect against possible threats,
such as eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion,
modification, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
