== Introduction

vCard <<RFC6350>> and iCalendar <<RFC5545>> are standards compliant to
the vObject data model <<I-D.calconnect-vobject-vformat>>.

These standards are used worldwide and require proper certain
localization elements suitable for multi-cultural use.

Previously, the only internationalization method for
vCard <<RFC6350>> and iCalendar <<RFC5545>> standards was
the `language` property parameter (<<RFC5545,3.2.10>>).

This document:

* defines additional internationalization features for the vObject data model,
including a separate property parameter that denotes the script used in a
property value, and a method to specify pronunciation of a property value
* defines realization methods of vObject internationalization in vFormat

This is a work product of the CalConnect TC-VCARD <<CALCONNECT-VCARD>>
and TC-CALENDAR <<CALCONNECT-CALENDAR>> committees.
